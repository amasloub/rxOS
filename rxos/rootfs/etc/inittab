# Note: BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels.  The runlevels field is
# completely ignored by BusyBox init. If you want runlevels, use
# sysvinit.
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# id        == tty to run on, or empty for /dev/console
# runlevels == ignored
# action    == one of sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, and once
# process   == program to run

# This file is a modified version of inittab
# file from the Buildroot project. In particular
# the mounting of proc was disabled as it is already
# done in the initramfs. Some code has been copied from
# The NextThingCo version of the inittab file as well,
# to facilitate gadget serial usage.
