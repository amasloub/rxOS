	  Creates the initial RAM filesystem image that can be
	  linked into the kernel. The compression option for the 
	  initial RAM filesystem image can be set in 
	  
	      Filesystem images > initial RAM... > Compression method

	  This package also adds a target-finalize hook which 
	  collects all cpio archive fragments added to 
	  $INIT_CPIO_LISTS variable and concatenates them into
	  a single file. If you wish to write packages that 
	  provide one-time boot hooks, you can add additional
	  content to the initiam RAM filesystem archvie by
	  appending to this list in the package's makefile.
