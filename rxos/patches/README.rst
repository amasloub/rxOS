About the patches
=================

The rxos/patches directory contains patches for the software that is built into
the firmware. These patches usually come from 3rd parties. This file documents
the patches that are present in this drectory and lists their sources and
licenses.

Each board has its board-specific patch directory, and the ``any`` directory
applies to all boards.
