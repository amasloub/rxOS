Linux
=====

Insert the card into the card reader. Find out the what your SD card's device
node is by using the ``dmesg`` command. Let's say the device node is
``/dev/sdb1``. Make sure the SD card is not mounted if you have an automouter.

To write the image to the card:

    $ dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/sdb1 bs=4m

Mac OSX
=======

Insert the card into the card reader. Find out what your SD card's device node
is by using the ``diskutil list`` command. Let's say the device node is
``/dev/disk4``. You need to unmount the disk:

    $ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4

Finally you can write the image:

    $ dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/disk4 bs=4m
