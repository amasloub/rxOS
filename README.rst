OuterBox 2: Outernet receiver firmware Mk2
==========================================

This repository contains build scripts for creating OuterBox 2, the second
generation Outernet receiver firmware. The firmware is designed to work on
Raspberry Pi version 3, and it should work on a stock Pi 3 without (too much)
modification.

The build is based on `Buildroot <https://buildroot.org/>`_.

Full documentation is available in the ``docs`` subdirectory.
