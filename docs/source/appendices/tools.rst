Appendix: Tools for working with compute boards
===============================================

This appendix lists some of the tools that could come in handy when working
with the compute boards (Raspberry Pi and CHIP).

Raspberry Pi tools
------------------

- HDMI-HDMI cable for connecting to an HDMI monitor or TV
- DVI-HDMI cable for connecting to a DVI monitor
- USB keyboard
- 5V/2A power adapter with microUSB cable
- spare SD cards (8GB+)
- Cat 5 cable (LAN cable) for connecting the board to a router
- USB stick

CHIP tools
----------

- USB-UART adapter
- male-male jumper (dupont) wire for grounding the FEL pin
- male-male or male-female jumper (dupont) wires (3x) for attaching USB UART
  adapters (connector type depends on the UART adapter)
- 5V/2A power adapter with stripped connector exposing voltage and ground wires
  for powering the board via CHG-IN pin
- USB cable with stripped connector for powering the board via CHG-IN pin
- precision tweezers for removing broken-off pins from the pin header
- passive or powered USB hub for connecting multiple external devices
- USB stick
