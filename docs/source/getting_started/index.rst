Getting stated with rxOS
************************

This chapter is aimed towards DIY users that wish to deploy rxOS on the
supported boards. If you purchased a rxOS-powered device from Outernet, you may
wish to skip ahead to :doc:`../how_it_works/index`.

A DIY build based on Raspbian is not covered in this guide. For instructions on
how to set up an Outernet L-band receiver using Raspbian, you should look at
the `Outernet L-band on Raspberry Pi
<http://outernet-l-band-on-raspberry-pi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ guide.
