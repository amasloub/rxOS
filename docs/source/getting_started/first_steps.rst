The first steps
===============

Once your receiver is all flashed and running, here are a few things you can
do.

Access the web-based interface
------------------------------

rxOS ships with a web-based user interface called `Librarian
<https://github.com/Outernet-Project/librarian>`_. This interface is available
on port 80 at the receiver's IP address.

In the most common scenario, you will find a new WiFi access point named 
'Outernet'. If you connect to it, you will be able to reach the web interface
at `10.10.10.10 <http://10.10.10.10/>`_ or `librarian.outernet
<http://librarian.outernet/>`_.

.. note::
    If your browser interferes with 'librarian.outernet' domain name and takes
    you to search instead, you can either prefix the 'http://' bit or use any
    domain name like example.com to reach the receiver's web interface.

You can get to the receiver a few different ways, which is documented in the
:doc:`../how_it_works/remote_access` section.

Plug in the external storage
----------------------------

rxOS-basd receivers support external storage devices to expand the storage
available on the SD card or built-in NAND flash. More about that can be read in
the :doc:`../how_it_works/external_storage`.

Point the antenna
-----------------

If you haven't already, you will want to adjust the antenna's pointing. Precise
pointing is a topic that is outside the scope of this guide.
